The middle-aged worker whose only ambition in life is to seek the unseekable,
to find the holy grale, the one and only treasure destined for him. 
This pathetic little man boring and foreseeable, nobody ever believed in him.
His life was a series of shames and never has he been able to outstand or
even be well thought of. His friends, as boring and dull as him are cheap
imitations of plastic figurines that are all over antic doll-shops from the
beginning of the century. Standing and covering with dust, pretending to be 
someone that is nothing to begin with. Nasty eating habits and psychological
problems from his early childhood never let him him get a proper education.
A giant rat was his role model for decades until he realized it was dead.
That kept him away from the public as well as his shorter right hand developed
during his escapades into the woods. Finally he found The institute were he
currently works. It gave him a glimpse of humanity, it was his first home
and there he got his first umbrella, the natural extension of his penis.
