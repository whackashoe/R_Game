		CHAPTER 4 - Space, time and beyond

	Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams 
glitter in the dark. near the Tannhauser gate. Giant defense ships on Nebula Six,
slowly melting in the darkness, waiting in perfect alignment for the eclipse. 
Torpedo heads warmed and prepared for expedition. Trade vessels running 
slowly through the Avalon bridge, fading in the distance. Night skies in 
Forrest Lands, shining in the neverending dawn. Green mysts surrounding
all that lives. Super Nova explosions, red waves of magnetic fields.
The space powder lightened by two suns. Constant changes of gravity,
the force pulling everything it can touch. Stars and the Anti-Stars.
Giant solar systems, billions of billions. Dust that shines. Shimmering
lights, distant on the horizon. The singularity. The point of no return.
Black suns. Extensions of planets, infinite connections of moons. The
spiral. Open surfaces, neverending landscapes. Pale grounds and the
mountains of Throb. Seeds of light, spread across the universe. Horses
with two legs. Volcano landscapes. Red. Tiny scout ships scattered in 
the night sky. Eleven Mothers. Riots on Pandrema. The rage of the Demon
King. Laser kites forming triangles. Trees containing blood. Hell on
Settus Orb. Rotating solids. The interplanetary light house. The pit of
doom. Pandemonium. The universe in a bottle. Twenty three light years
of a second. The planet of spider-jelly's. The wrath of the Gloom Pooms.
Explosions on Hidel ships, the loss of the millions. The beginning.
The end.
