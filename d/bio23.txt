	Zorth

The fighter. Born in the suburbs of Liverpool in a coal miners family
he never had it easy. Every day they ate coal with fungus from the ceiling.
Mother was a vegetarian and ate only fungus. For holidays father used to steal
charcoal from the docks so his family could have a feast. Once caught,
his legs were cut-off as punishment. The judge then realized he had made
a mistake and quickly ordered to cut-off his hands. Knowing his lesson he
packed all his ambition into his children. He wanted to give them a kickstart
in life, although he had nothing to kick with. Zorth was a brave young fellow 
and never cried. He dreamt of getting out of the ghetto into the modern rooms 
of Paris and Milan. He imagined himself rich, full of splendor discussing
art-deco paintings in a bored milllionaires wife posed baroque styled cottage
drinking appetizers with white cheese. He studied hard, took horse-back riding
lessons, mastered the spade and the 180 Barspin BMX trick. When he was ready
to conquer the modern world and become a high-class citizen, well-known and
respected, he got a strange fever and became an outsource programmer for HP.
He died three weeks later.
