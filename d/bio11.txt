A portugese sail crafter. Inventor of the modern sewing machine.
All his life he dreamt of sailing on the ocean, drifting on the seven seas,
slipping through the giant waves and screaming cross words in the storm.
Unfortunatly he suffered from diabetes and couldn't eat ice-cream.
In those days all sailors ate strawberry ice-cream and unfortunatly he didn't
make in to the vast world of oceanic adventures. In the 80's  he became famous
as the widowed ex-baseball player in the hit sitcom "Who's the Boss".
After years of success he had to quit the industry because he promised his
grandfather that he would make a sex change when he turns 49. Being a 49 years
young woman he lit a candle and put it on the window. 
The fire that spread that day killed 449 people in 49 seconds.
