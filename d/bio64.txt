	Strangler

The sleepless and mindless creature of the swamps haunted the minds of
kindergarten children long before Lionel Richie. Struggling in the Battle
of the Bulge on December 16, 1944 the only thing he could focus on was how
to survive. The instincts that helped him defeat the nazi Germany made him a
cruel and vicious monster. Once a young optimistic nordic fellow with milk
under his nose he became the beast that lived in his soul for years. The war
forever marked itself on him and left wounds that could never heal. 
Licking his scars in the night he felt nothing but rage in his heart.
He stifled feelings deep inside and they were growing in him for years.
The problems were transposed to other beings and all his frustration was
loaded off on the innocent small ones. He knew it was wrong but he kept
on harming the creatures which made him even angrier. He couldn't look at
himself in the mirror. Probably because he didn't have a mirror at home.
For years it grew in him until he popped, his small brain didn't stand it
and became a jelly, lemon flavoured jelly. From this day he thought of
himself as the little girl on the pony. To the end of his years he was
seen riding his imaginary horse and combing his non-existing golden hair.
He was remembered as the guy with a little head, but big ego.
