'Look at yourself, what have you achieved in your life? Are you happy? 
Are you a sensitive, sympathetic person? Do you have someone who loves you?
 Or maybe you're over 20, and you spend your time playing a crappy
  2d platformer game? Even if you're not, you're still just a stupid
   piece of thrash, a part of big f**** mass media-driven community zombie,
    that just doesn't do anything special, remember, the world is a sick,
     sad place, people are dying and fighting everyday,
      there are people mentally sick, people that are killed because
       of the colour of their skin or religion, they keep you doped
        with religion, and sex and tv. You're just a pathetic lifeform
         that didn't do anything to change this world. We light a candle
          upon a place we call Hell and pretend that we're in Heaven.
           You'll die, and nothing's gonna change'
