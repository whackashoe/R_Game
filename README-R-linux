For sound to work, you need either:

* SDL-mixer with mp3 support (provided SDL-mixer doesn't have this), or
* Convert mp3 files to ogg vorbis format (keep filename):
	s/benny.wav
	s/m/*.wav

Alternately you can try keeping the FMOD sound engine, but I had little 
success with this myself. FMOD doesn't like ALSA or even ALSA's OSS 
emulation very much.
