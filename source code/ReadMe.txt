								R
========================================================================


	R is a platform/puzzle/action/adventure game created from 
	Michal Marcinkowski's discussions with Dolny sometime in 
	2004 and 2005. The game is not finished and never will be.
	There are whole sections of the game not done, missing graphics,
	animations, sounds, maps and cutscenes. However the game is complete 
	in its design and is fully playable from beginning to end. 
	So don't worry about the missing maps, it'll just make you finish
	the game faster and enjoy the magnificent ending.
	
	R is released as open source. You may do whatever you wish with it.
	You can even develop the game and complete it. But just to warn you
	the source code doesn't really take advantages of c++ language and
	is a pain in the ass to work with. There is one favor you can do if
	you have programming skills. Compile the game for linux and other
	systems. The engine should compile without problems as it is based
	on SDL and FMod. When you do that please e-mail the executables to:
	michal.marcinkowski@gmail.com.

	If by any chance you would like to continue the project or make
	a completely new game based on it, there are thousands of ideas 
	waiting	that didn't make it into the game. Please contact Dolny 
	if you're interested: maciejgie@googlemail.com.
